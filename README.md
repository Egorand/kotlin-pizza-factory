kotlin-pizza-factory
====================

A simple example of annotation processing with Kotlin's 
[kapt](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/kapt.html) and Square's 
[kotlinpoet](https://github.com/square/kotlinpoet). Largely inspired by 
[Hannes Dorfmann](https://github.com/sockeqwe)'s 
[annotationprocessing101](https://github.com/sockeqwe/annotationprocessing101) project.
